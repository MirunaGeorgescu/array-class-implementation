# 👩‍💻 Array Class Implementation in C++

This is the implementation of an array class in C++, developed as the first project for the object-oriented programming class I took in my first year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest.

## 📝 Project Requirements

The project involved creating a C++ class, "Array," with the following features:

- Private attributes for the array itself and the number of elements
- Constructors for initialization with a specific value for all components and for copy operations
- Public methods for reading and displaying the array
- Public methods for updating the number of components and initializing the components with a given number
- Operator overloads for various operations such as addition, subtraction, comparison, and others
- Friend function for providing the number of elements

## 📊 Methodology and Implementation Details

The project utilized several key methods to ensure efficient and accurate array manipulation. Notable features include:

- Implementation of constructors for different scenarios, such as initialization with a specific value and from keyboard or file input
- Overloading of operators for addition, subtraction, equality, and other arithmetic operations
- Implementation of friend functions to facilitate operations such as getting the length of the array
